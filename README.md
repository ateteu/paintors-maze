# Paintor's Maze

**Paintor's Maze** is a maze game with color-based mechanics, originally created using a visual tool and now fully recreated from scratch through real programming, following object-oriented principles and software design best practices.

The player must navigate mazes by solving small color-based puzzles:

- The character collects colored blocks that change its own color.  
- Colored doors can only be passed through if the character has the matching color.  
- Color combinations are part of the challenge (e.g., blue + green = yellow).

The project focuses on modular structure, level loading via pixel art images, and clear separation between logic, visuals, and data.
